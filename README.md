So, this script is pretty straightforward. It keeps an eye on specific spots on your screen and checks if any of those pixels are black. If it finds a black pixel, it moves the cursor there and clicks. The loop runs continuously until you hit the 'q' key to stop it. 
It's using `pyautogui` to check the pixel colors and `win32api` to move the mouse and handle the clicking. There are four different spots it monitors, and it clicks whenever it finds a black pixel at any of those locations.
Thats pretty much it, I dont know why im making this read file any longer
